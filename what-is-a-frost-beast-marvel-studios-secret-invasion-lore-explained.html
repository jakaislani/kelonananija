Recommended Videos Groot, Cull Obsidian, Extremis, and Frost Beast. These are the four parts making up whatever the Skrull’s plans may be. While some of these are straightforward, unless you’ve been paying close attention you might have forgotten about the Frost Beasts."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

They have a massive physique, however, this doesn’t stop them from running at extremely fast speeds. They also have the ability to use ice as a shield around their bodies making them quite the formidable foe — as Thor and Loki found out.</p><p data-characters=203 data-current-count=516 data-injectable=true>Yes, Secret Invasion isn’t the first time we’ve seen this species featured. In fact, MCU fans will recognize the name from both the original <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Thor</a> film and its forgettable sequel Thor: The Dark World.</p><p data-characters=333 data-current-count=333 data-injectable=false>In Thor, Laufey wakes multiple of these beasts from their slumber, sending them to hunt and kill the God of Thunder and his friends. This wouldn’t seem to be where the Skrulls in Secret Invasion would have nabbed their DNA though. It’s more likely that they would’ve gotten it during the events of Thor: The Dark World.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>How did the Skrulls get Frost Beast DNA?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=633 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=366 data-current-count=366 data-injectable=false>In the sequel, multiple Frost Beasts are brought to Earth via convergence portals. This would seem like the most likely time for Skrull scientists to get their hands on the beast’s DNA. While theories would suggest that the Skrulls have plans to use this DNA to create Super Skrulls <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">without needing the Fantastic Four</a>, as of right now, this remains to be seen.</p><p data-characters=278 data-current-count=644 data-injectable=false>Frost Beasts have had quite the history in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. There are now two mysteries left unsolved: whether or not the Skrulls have plans to create Super Skrulls and if there will be a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">second season of Secret Invasion</a>. Hopefully, answers to both are on the way.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZKKrXZZ6p77OrKtmmpWWwLV5zJqpr52cYsC1wcOipqxlo5qws7HTZqCnrpGotrC6jKWmq51dmsWxuMCipZ6cXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
