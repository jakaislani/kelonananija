After attending the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, he eventually ended up in Boston where he began his career as a doctor. After becoming disenchanted with Western medicine, however, Chopra turned to alternative medicine. In 1995, Chopra, already a prolific book author, founded the Chopra Center for Well Being in Carlsbad, California.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life and Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Deepak Chopra was born on October 22, 1947 in New Delhi, India. The son of an eminent cardiologist, Krishnan Chopra, Deepak at first decided against following his father's career path, wanting instead to pursue a career as a journalist. Eventually, however, he became enthralled with the subject of medicine and enrolled at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in his native city.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Chopra envisioned a career in Western medicine, and in 1970 moved to the United States, leaving his home country with just $25 in his pocket and the promise of a residency at a hospital in New Jersey. Following the residency, Chopra landed in Boston, where he quickly rose to chief of medicine at New England Memorial Hospital.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Despite his rising career, Chopra became disenchanted with Western medicine and its reliance on prescription drugs. The work began to wear on the promising doctor, who would later claim that he smoked up to a pack of cigarettes a day and drank consistently. "Very unhappy people, physicians," he has said. "The relatives of patients with whom they deal are demanding, litigious, intimidating. That's the environment of medicine. Most of my fellow colleagues were very stressed; a lot of them were addicts. I used to experience the most extraordinary frustration and tightness. My great fear was getting into trouble. Malpractice suits are a big deal in the United States."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">It's during this time that Chopra read a book on transcendental medicine that changed his life, and eventually his career path. As his interest in alternative medicine deepened, so did his view on the limits of Western medicine.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After a meeting with transcendental mediation guru Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, Chopra quit his job at New England Memorial Hospital and started the Maharishi Ayur-Veda Products International, a company that specialized in alternative products, like herbal teas and oils. Co-founded with the Maharishi, the company successfully launched Chopra into the world of alternative medicine. Chopra helped oversee the creation of several affiliated clinics and, he became well-known among celebrities including <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/elizabeth-taylor data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Elizabeth Taylor" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Elizabeth Taylor</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/michael-jackson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Michael Jackson" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Michael Jackson</a> and fashion designer <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/history-culture/donna-karan data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Donna Karan" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Donna Karan</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Best-Selling Author</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">By the early 1990s, Chopra had split off from the Maharishi and relocated to California, where he became the executive director of the Sharp Institute for Human Potential and Mind/Body Medicine. But he eventually clashed with his bosses and, in 1995, he started the Chopra Center for Well Being.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">By this time, Chopra had become an international success. His first book, Quantum Healing: Exploring the Frontiers of Mind/Body Medicine, published in 1989, proved to be a decent seller. But it was his 1993 release Ageless Body, Timeless Mind, which shot Chopra into full-fledged celebrity status, selling more than a million hardcover copies alone.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At a time when the self-help industry was coming into its own, Chopra became one of its leading faces. His core message centers around the idea that the reliance on a material world complicates finding peace and happiness.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">To Chopra, the answers to our health and happiness can be found internally. His message has certainly resonated with the greater public. In total, Chopra has published 86 books, which includes 14 bestsellers such as The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success, which have been translated into a number of different languages. Chopra has also contributed as a regular columnist for the San Francisco Chronicle and the Washington Post.</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Media Projects</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In June 1999, Time magazine dubbed Chopra "the poet-prophet of alternative medicine" and called him one of the top 100 heroes of the century.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">He regularly brought his message to the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/oprah-winfrey data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Oprah Winfrey " class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Oprah Winfrey </a>Show and was a confidante of pop superstar Michael Jackson.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">His career has even seen him delve into the music-making business. He's collaborated with a range of artists, from Madonna to Dave Stewart of the 1980s band the Eurythmics.</p><h2 data-node-id=28 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Personal Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Chopra married his wife, Rita, in 1970.
