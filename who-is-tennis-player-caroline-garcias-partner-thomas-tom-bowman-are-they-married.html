Are They Married?</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-08-18</div><p>A notable tennis player, Caroline Garcia, walked down on aisle with Thomas “Tom” Bowman on October 14, 2017.</p><p>Carline is a well-skilled French tennis player born in 1993 and hails from Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France. She competes professionally in both doubles and singles and previously enlisted in the top 10.</p><p>In 2017, she won both the Wuhan Open and the China Open and was named the first player to achieve the Wuhan Open and China Open in the same calendar year. The story of her achievement continued, and she attained a career-high WTA singles ranking of No. 4 on September 10, 2018.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=caroline-garcia-partner-thomas-%e2%80%9ctom%e2%80%9d-bowman-are-they-married></span>Caroline Garcia Partner Thomas “Tom” Bowman: Are They Married?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Yes, French pro tennis player Caroline and Thomas “Tom” Bowman tied the knot on October 14, 2017.</p><p>Tom proposed to Caroline to spend forever with him on n October 14, 2017. And after one year, they exchanged wedding vows in New Braunfels, TX, according to&nbsp;Thomas & Caroline. Since the pair wedded in a private ceremony, no information about their marriage has been revealed yet.</p><p>In the midst of her back-to-back win at Wimbledon, several rumors were circulating that the tennis player was gay. However, her marriage to Thomas abandoned all the gossip.</p><p>Several online portals shared adorable pictures of their wedding and blessed the newlywed couple with their blissful married life.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=about-their-age-gap></span>About Their Age Gap<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Eventhough, the exact birthdate of Thomas is unknown, there seems to be around a three to five years age gap between the couple.</p><p>Caroline is currently running at 28 and already making a bright career in tennis. Tom and Caroline crossed their path for the first time at the University of the Incarnate Word in San Antonio, Texas.</p><p>Tom was a member of the Roadie Team while Caroline was hosting as a junior at UIW. The first meeting could not be more fruitful for the beginning of their relationship.</p><p>Everything changed in the summer of 2012 in San Diego, California, when the pair surprisingly “re-met.” Interestingly, both of them worked for Invisible Children at that time.</p><p>The second meeting became the reason for God’s remarkable work to reunite them so they could start their affair, and currently, they are a perfectly matched couple.</p><p>Even though the pair managed to keep their love life behind the curtains, we wish them eternal happiness and a lifetime of togetherness.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-much-is-thomas-%e2%80%9ctom%e2%80%9d-bowman-net-worth></span>How Much Is Thomas “Tom” Bowman Net Worth?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Caroline’s husband, Thomas “Tom” Bowman, probably accumulated a massive net worth.</p><p>However, he is yet to share his earnings details. Since the pair have been enjoying a private life, Caroline did not open anything regarding her partner.</p><p>We are unaware of his profession but analyzing their lifestyle; he must be earning a considerable amount. Caroline is believed to have more than $10 million net worth.</p><p>At Wimbledon 2022, she will compete against Emma Raducanu in a match with a £40,350,000 prize for the victor. She already amassed massive wealth from her hard work and dedication to tennis.</p><p>We hope to come up with additional information on Caroline Garcia’s partner’s profession and income in the future.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4ytnKemmah6sbjAspyrZZOWv7C4yKecZp%2BRp7CqrdJmp5qqpKOys3nToaammaNiwbC5jJumsKWRo3qivsRmq6GdqWK6or7RopydZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
