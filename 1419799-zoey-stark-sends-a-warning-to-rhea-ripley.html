At Survivor Series, I get to go one-on-one with Rhea Ripley. Yes! She gave me the Rip Tide. But I also gave her the Z360. Okay? She never pinned me. And I know that Rhea knows that I could beat her. And that is why she is scared. That is why she has a tough exterior right now. She know I could beat her one… two… three. Survivor Series, you are looking at the new Women’s World Champion,” Zoey Stark said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNqcHBxaWLHsLHYZqqtmaKgerSxzZ2qZpldrK6zusinnmasn2K%2FqbHAZqmiqJyaxg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
