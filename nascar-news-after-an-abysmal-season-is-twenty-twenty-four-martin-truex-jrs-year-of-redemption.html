Going into the playoffs. Truex Jr. was considered one of the top guns in the competition and led the odds to win the championship. Having won the 2017 Cup Series championship and the 2023 regular-season championship, he had the experience, too. Yet he failed to impact the trajectory of the playoffs.</p><p>Driving the No.19 Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota Camry, Martin Truex Jr could only record two top-10 finishes in the playoffs. While he went far in the competition because of his massive playoff points tally, his title pursuit derailed as hopes of a second championship faded slowly. As the 2024 season inches closer, let’s look at his 2023 season and what the upcoming year could have in store for Truex Jr.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Martin Truex Jr’s frustrating 2023 season summed up</h2><p>The pattern of Martin Truex Jr’s performances in the past two seasons has been strange. In 2022, the 43-year-old driver had the most painful season of his career as he failed to win a race that year. For the first time since 2014, Truex Jr. was not racing in the playoffs. The disappointment was too much for him to handle, as he contemplated retiring from the sport after that season.</p><p>However, Martin Truex Jr returned to race for JGR in 2023 after a mental tug of war and some introspection. It was a great decision as he regained the momentum and confidence he had lost the previous year and recorded three wins, nine top-five finishes, and 17 top-tens. His performances guaranteed him a victory over regular-season rival and <strong><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Hendrick Motorsports</a> </strong>driver <strong><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>William Byron</a></strong> as he entered the playoffs as the top seed.</p><p>But the No.19 team experienced a sudden decline in quality as the playoffs progressed. With his consistency in the regular season, one would expect him to display some of the same in the playoffs. But alas, Martin Truex Jr. could only finish within the top 10 twice in nine races of the playoffs and was ousted in the Round of 8.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Martin Truex Jr. says he will return to the No. 19 car for Joe Gibbs Racing in 2024.</p><p>Retirement will have to wait another year.</p><p>— Austin Konenski (@AustinKonenski) <a href=#>August 5, 2023</a></p><p>While the performance was an upgrade over the horrendous 2022 season, Martin Truex Jr’s hopes of landing a second championship were completely washed away. Not just him, but <strong><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Joe Gibbs Racing</a></strong> drivers had a similar arc in the 2023 season.</p><p><strong><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Denny Hamlin</a></strong> peaked during the initial rounds of the playoffs and was held as an outright favorite for the championship. On the other hand, <strong><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Christopher Bell</a></strong> made it to the season finale with some great performances, but a mechanical failure ruined the biggest race of his career, and he was forced to retire early.</p><p>However, the biggest question that remains is whether Martin Truex Jr will be able to deliver the goods in 2024.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Age is a big factor for Truex Jr</h2><p>Martin Truex Jr has won 34 Cup races in his career. 24 of these wins arrived between 2015 and 2019. Since turning 40 in 2020, the New Jersey native has won only eight races. While the implications are bleak, it could be possible that age has a say in Truex Jr’s performances. Considering the intense competition in the Cup Series, winning a race has only become tougher.</p><p>The No.19 Camry has been undoubtedly one of the best cars in 2023. Fast and consistent, Martin Truex Jr piloted it expertly through tough situations as he claimed the regular-season championship. However, as things got rough in the latter stages of the season, a disagreement between him and crew chief James Small erupted. Truex was often seen furiously lashing out at his pit crew on the team radio.</p><p>It also could be a minor setback to the team’s plans, as high-pressure situations like these can often get the better of the best of men. Managing his relationship with crew chief Smalls will be pivotal to his success in 2024. Regarding his dynamic with fellow drivers, Truex can be considered somewhat of a pacifist and has had no notable fights on the track in 2023.</p><p>If Martin Truex Jr aims to contend for the 2024 championship, there will be some usual suspects standing against him. The most likely names outside JGR are <strong><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Kyle Larson</a></strong>, <strong><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Kyle Busch</a></strong>, and William Byron. As for his retirement from the sport, he had revealed his plans to continue racing earlier this year. As he returns to JGR for another season, his eyes will definitely be on the prize.</p><p><strong>Watch This Story: <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Kenny Wallace: A NASCAR legend’s Hall of Fame induction&nbsp;</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pr%2FSnqWtoZGhubq%2Fz6ipratemLyue82aqpyZomK7psPSZpifrJWneqK6jJqZsqudlrluv8SaqqimXZ7AbsDWnqWtsV2pxKa607Jkn6elp3qurdGtoKdlpKfCpsSMo6msZamarrN5zp9kq52UmrqxwMiopWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
