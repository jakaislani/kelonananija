There are popular kids. There are those who want to be popular. There are those who are left out. These dynamics are particularly toxic in the high school in "Moxie," where "rankings" are published on social media every year, rankings like "Best Rack," "Most Bangable," etc. Vivian finds it annoying, but also doesn't have any sense she could push back. Her cluelessness is challenged when a new girl named Lucy (Alycia Pascual-Peña) makes waves, first by challenging the summer reading list, and then by standing up to the menacing cocky football-player bully, Mitchell Wilson (Patrick Schwarzenegger).</description></item><item><title>Rashomon movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1950)</title><link>/great-movie-rashomon-1950.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/great-movie-rashomon-1950.html</guid><description>The genius of "Rashomon" is that all of the flashbacks are both true and false. True, in that they present an accurate portrait of what each witness thinks happened. False, because as Kurosawa observes in his autobiography, "Human beings are unable to be honest with themselves about themselves. They cannot talk about themselves without embellishing."
The wonder of "Rashomon" is that while the shadowplay of truth and memory is going on, we are absorbed by what we trust is an unfolding story.</description></item><item><title>Cranberry Mojitos - Mom On Timeout</title><link>/cranberry-mojito-recipe.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/cranberry-mojito-recipe.html</guid><description>Easy Cranberry Mojitos are the perfect way to celebrate the holiday season!
