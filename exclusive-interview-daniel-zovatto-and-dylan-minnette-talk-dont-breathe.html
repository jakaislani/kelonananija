Dylan Minnette: It’s like a steady camera, and it is in the dark. There’s a light around the lens. It’s a ring made of light. That’s all they have. It’s just this light on you, creating the illuminated effect.

Could you see&nbsp;when filming, and how did Fede pull off the shot?</p><p data-characters=445 data-current-count=635 data-injectable=true><strong>Dylan Minnette</strong>: It’s like a steady camera, and it is in the dark. There’s a light around the lens. It’s a ring made of light. That’s all they have. It’s just this light on you, creating the illuminated effect. Then when it’s off, that basement really was pitch-black. Fede didn’t want us to see anything. There’d be a little sliver of sunlight coming through a window, and I’d point it&nbsp;out.</p><p data-characters=259 data-current-count=259 data-injectable=false>Before that, in a random studio where we were shooting, we did a test with an infrared camera. Fede did it for Jane and I. He spun me around really fast and he filmed me with a camera that was green, or infrared. Then he was like, “Find your way.”</p><p data-characters=471 data-current-count=730 data-injectable=true>There were obstacles, like shelves, and I really was trying to find my way in this pitch-black room while everyone was being quiet. He filmed me doing it, and I looked like a fool. But he filmed what I look like in the dark, so when we got to that scene, I had already memorized what I’d do with my hands. You don’t move your eyes in the dark, you move your head. I was nervous. How was I going to sell not being able to see? With Fede, we had practice…</p><p data-characters=199 data-current-count=199 data-injectable=false><strong>Daniel Zovatto</strong>: I love the shots when you’re leaning into the camera like you don’t know it’s there. And when&nbsp;you yell out “Rocky!” – Jane’s character name.</p><p data-characters=241 data-current-count=440 data-injectable=true><strong>Dylan Minnette</strong>: What’s funny is that in that scene, on paper, I don’t say Rocky. I just knock something over with my foot.&nbsp;While watching, even I wasn’t ready for that moment. I was like, “Why did I yell that?”</p><p data-characters=76 data-current-count=76 data-injectable=false>WGTC: So do you see yourselves as heroes, villains, or a little bit of both?</p><p data-characters=272 data-current-count=348 data-injectable=false><strong>Dylan Minnette</strong>: I view us&nbsp;as the hero characters. I’m rooting for them. Anybody can argue that you can root for the blind man, I guess? I don’t. But I also don’t view them as heroes. I don’t think they’re good guys. Definitely not good guys.</p><p data-characters=63 data-current-count=411 data-injectable=true><strong>Daniel Zovatto</strong>: More like guys with great ideas…[laughs].</p><p data-characters=398 data-current-count=398 data-injectable=false><strong>Dylan Minnette</strong>: We actually filmed quite a bit more that explained our character’s motives, and how they justify what they’re doing – at least for me. It doesn’t quite show in the movie, but Alex found a way to convince himself that what he’s doing is fine, and that’s the only way he’s able to do it. He’s a good person. He has the right intentions.</p><p data-characters=180 data-current-count=578 data-injectable=true>WGTC: While I really enjoyed the film, I’ll admit that I walked away wondering why Alex was risking his life, besides his crush on Rocky. Was there more of a backstory there?</p><p data-characters=542 data-current-count=542 data-injectable=true><strong>Dylan Minnette</strong>: Yes, there absolutely was. There are quite a few scenes that, after talking with Fede, you will see, and&nbsp;there’s definitely a bigger explanation. I read that some people felt similarly, but Fede is still ahead of it. It’s there. It’s written. But they do imply it – you can see Alex cares for, and likes Rocky. And given the situation, I think that’s all you need to know. The scenes we did, you feel like you want them, but knowing what they comprise, I don’t think they need to be there.</p><p data-characters=76 data-current-count=76 data-injectable=false>WGTC: I mean, I completely forgot about it when you all get locked in…</p><p data-characters=114 data-current-count=190 data-injectable=false><strong>Dylan Minnette</strong>: Absolutely. There’s definitely more backstory filmed, but it doesn’t need to be there.</p><p data-characters=42 data-current-count=232 data-injectable=false>WGTC: What drew you to the film initially?</p><p data-characters=244 data-current-count=476 data-injectable=true><strong>Daniel Zovatto</strong>: My character attracted me. He’s someone I never played, or brought to life, so that excited me a lot. Also, just getting to work with Fede, since I’m a fan of Evil Dead, made this a huge “Yes.” No debate.</p><p data-characters=47 data-current-count=47 data-injectable=false><strong>Dylan Minnette</strong>: That’s my answer exactly.</p><p data-characters=199 data-current-count=246 data-injectable=false>WGTC: How was it working with Jane Levy? She’s delivers another tremendous role as your parter. She’s able to balance strength and fear with ease. How easy did this make her to work with?</p><p data-characters=164 data-current-count=410 data-injectable=true><strong>Dylan Minnette</strong>: She’s very passionate about believing in her part, and this pays off on screen. She’s so amazing in the movie, and her method, it works.</p><p data-characters=217 data-current-count=217 data-injectable=false><strong>Daniel Zovatto</strong>: Jane killed it – well, everyone did. But Jane carries the weight of the story, and I think she is a great actress. She’s very specific, and as an actor, that’s a good quality to have.</p><p data-characters=81 data-current-count=298 data-injectable=false>WGTC: So what’s on the docket next? Dylan, any talk of a Goosebumps sequel?</p><p data-characters=214 data-current-count=512 data-injectable=true><strong>Dylan Minnette</strong>: It’s funny, because I just finished press for Goosebumps, and every time press would ask what I have coming next, I’d say Don’t Breathe – but now I don’t have anything.</p><p data-characters=85 data-current-count=85 data-injectable=false><strong>Daniel Zovatto</strong>: He’s got a sick band, that’s what he’s going to do.</p><p data-characters=193 data-current-count=278 data-injectable=false><strong>Dylan Minnette</strong>: We’ve been called The Narwhals, but I think we’re going to change it. We’ll have newer shit this year that’s even better than what’s out there now.</p><p data-characters=164 data-current-count=442 data-injectable=true><strong>Daniel Zovatto</strong>:&nbsp;I’ve got Fear The Walking Dead going on, and I’m shooting an indie called Los Valientes, which will be my first&nbsp;Spanish-speaking role.</p><p data-characters=171 data-current-count=171 data-injectable=false>That concludes our interview, but I’d like to thank both Dylan and Daniel for chatting with us. Be sure to catch <strong>Don’t Breathe</strong> when it opens August 26th, 2016!</p>Pages: <a href=# class=post-page-numbers>1</a> <span class="post-page-numbers current" aria-current=page>2</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJonLGbnKrAqsLEZqCnrJWnw6qx1mabmqaZmrluxs6vmK2sn2Kur7CMnbClmZ5iuqq6zZ6rrZ1dqa6tt4ydpqesXZe%2Fpq3ToZxoal8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
