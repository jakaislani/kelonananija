She lives in Scottsdale, Arizona, and has a large following on the internet.</p><p>Whitney’s owner took a snapshot of her sitting on a blanket with a glass of red wine on June 12, 2019. The caption reads, “A little wine on Wednesdays.” Like if you agree! ”&nbsp;The shot has subsequently received approximately 27,000 likes, thanks in part to the meme’s popularity.</p><p>Sometime before March 2021, an anonymous Instagram artist created an image macro using the photo of the dog, captioned using the Whisper app, “not too fond of gay people.” The meme was started on March 23, 2021, and it is still going strong. However, it did not have the same level of virality as the current “homophobic dog” meme.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=a-new-homophobic-dog-meme-is-taking-over-the-internet></span>A New Homophobic Dog Meme is Taking Over The Internet<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In the year 2022, images of Whitney Chewston became the focus of “ironic homophobic memes.”&nbsp;Twitter user @ForeverElSanto tweeted three Whitney Cheston ‘homophobic dog’ memes on March 3, 2022, which received approximately 62k likes.</p><p>On March 25, Lil Nas X&nbsp;joined&nbsp;the fray, further boosting the meme’s popularity. His request for “additional photographs of that homophobic dog” received 133.4 thousand likes. It also prompted several other Twitter users to tweet similar jokes.</p><p>Furthermore, in the spring of 2022, a screenshot of an alleged Washington Post article entitled, “This dog is the new face of internet homophobia,” with an image of a dog, went viral. The article, however, is not true.</p><p>The bogus report was disseminated in mid-May 2022 under the byline of Washington Post technology journalist Taylor Lorenz. The bogus screenshot was most likely inspired by a meme starring Whitney Chewston, a real-life dog. According to an article on LGBTQ Nation dated May 16, 2022, “This dog is the new face of internet homophobia”.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=whitney-chewston-diva-dachshund-on-instagram></span>Whitney Chewston Diva Dachshund On Instagram<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Whitney Chewston has an Instagram handle under the username&nbsp;@whitney_chewston&nbsp;and has over 102k followers on the platform.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYnsGvsdhmmqGdp6jBsLqMoqpmrJiaeqW7xmagp2WknbJuusSwZKGnnaS9qbvBoppmpZWism7AwKSgp59dpMOmvoytn55lmaPBpr7Nnqtmal8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
