He then moved into film acting, appearing in hits such as Bad Boys and Big Momma's House. Lawrence also had his own sitcom, Martin, which ran on Fox in the 1990s.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Actor and comedian Martin Lawrence was born on April 16, 1965, in Frankfurt, Germany. Lawrence's father served in the U.S. military and left the family when Martin was 8 years old. He pursued a love of boxing as a teen, but also displayed a gift for comedy. A teacher encouraged Lawrence to attend an open mic night at a local comedy club, and his career as a comic was born.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">TV Shows and Films</h2><h2 data-node-id=7 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Def Comedy Jam'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Shortly after moving to California, Lawrence got a guest spot on the television show What's Happening Now!! This appearance led to his big break in television as the host of HBO's groundbreaking Def Comedy Jam.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Martin'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Lawrence moved into the spotlight with the launch of the Fox sitcom Martin in 1992. Along with starring as disc jockey Martin Payne, Lawrence often appeared as other characters like Mama Payne and the outrageous neighbor Sheneneh Jenkins. Martin was a big hit for Fox, although the final season, which ended in spring 1997, was clouded by accusations of sexual harassment from co-star Tisha Campbell.</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Bad Boys' and 'Big Momma's House'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Lawrence also parlayed his early successes into a movie career. After appearances in features like House Party (1990) and Boomerang (1992), he hit it big with a co-starring role alongside <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/will-smith data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Will Smith" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Will Smith</a> in the buddy cop flick Bad Boys (1995). Five years later, the actor seized the opportunity to shine in Big Momma's House, with audiences responding favorably to his brand of crude but endearing comedy.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Lawrence went on to reprise his roles in Bad Boys II (2003), Big Momma's House 2 (2006) and Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son (2011). In early 2020, he readied to rejoin Smith in Bad Boys for Life.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Wild Hogs'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2007, Lawrence co-starred with Tim Allen, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/john-travolta data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="John Travolta" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">John Travolta</a> and William H. Macy in the midlife crisis comedy Wild Hogs, which earned lukewarm reviews from critics but grossed more than $250 million globally. He followed with roles in the ensemble comedies Welcome Home Roscoe Jennings (2008) and Death at a Funeral (2010).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">By the 2010s, Lawrence was looking to regain the mojo that had once propelled him to the upper rungs of the Hollywood pecking order. A planned sitcom with CBS fell through, and Partners, a legal comedy that co-starred Kelsey Grammer, was cancelled after 10 episodes on FX in 2014.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2016, Lawrence released his first stand-up special in 14 years with Showtime's Doin' Time: Uncut. Three years later, he returned to the big screen with the role of Captain Wack in the stoner comedy The Beach Bum.</p><ul data-node-id=20 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Birth Year: 1965</li><li>Birth date: April 16, 1965</li><li>Birth City: Frankfurt</li><li>Birth Country: Germany</li><li>Gender: Male</li><li>Best Known For: Comedian Martin Lawrence got hist start hosting HBO's 'Def Comedy Jam' before appearing in movies like 'Bad Boys' and 'Big Momma's House.'</li><li>Industries</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Television</li><li>Comedy</li></ul><li>Astrological Sign: Aries</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><ul data-node-id=25 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Martin Lawrence Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/actors/martin-lawrence</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li></ul><ul data-node-id=28 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>I don't want to sound facetious, but humour is the key to the soul.
