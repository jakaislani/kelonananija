The post in question was a sexually explicit image that was taken from&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a previous “romantic encounter”</a>&nbsp;from 10 years ago. Agdal claims that Danis posted the photo without her consent and reposted it to “maximize the number of views,” and it was only removed when Misfits Boxing, the organization behind the Danis vs. Paul match, threatened to cancel the sporting event.</p><p>“Danis posted the photograph — entirely uncensored — from his X (Twitter) account, without Plaintiff’s consent. Later that day, Danis reposted the explicit photograph in order to maximize the number of views it would receive.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=559 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=497 data-current-count=497 data-injectable=true>Agdal also listed other posts that Danis made that have upset her, such as uploading old videos of her that were stored in her Snapchat archive. She also alleged that Danis “hacked” her personal account to grab hold of the video or obtained it from someone who managed to do so. The 31-year-old model wants $150k per violation of federal law, and is asking the judge to bar Danis from posting explicit images of her in the future, claiming that his actions are damaging her reputation.</p><p data-characters=367 data-current-count=367 data-injectable=false>Danis commented on the lawsuit on X (aka Twitter), claiming that the lawsuit is putting the fight in jeopardy, especially if he’s sent to prison because of it. He announced that he won’t stop because “f*** the system,” and Paul is a “dead man walking.” According to TMZ, Agdal isn’t asking the athlete to be sent behind bars.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=667 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Nina Adgel has filed a massive lawsuit against me.
