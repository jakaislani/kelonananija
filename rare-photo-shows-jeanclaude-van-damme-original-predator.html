However, the costume was hot, heavy and cumbersome, and it was ultimately decided that the actor was too ill-equipped and even too small to play the big bad.</p><p data-characters=373 data-current-count=373 data-injectable=false>As everybody knows, the cast of Predator is positively dripping in testosterone, and the crew were concerned that having the diminutive by comparison Van Damme trying to pose a serious onscreen threat to a hulking ensemble that included Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers, Jesse Ventura and Sonny Landham simply wasn’t believable enough, even for a sci-fi actioner.</p><p data-characters=396 data-current-count=769 data-injectable=true>Van Damme ultimately left the project and was replaced by Kevin Peter Hall, who was over a foot and a half taller, while the Predator itself was given an overhaul by designer Stan Winston, with an assist from James Cameron after the Terminator director suggested mandibles. A rare picture of the future action hero under the costume has now been unearthed, though, and you can check it out below.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/jean-claude-van-damme-predator.jpg><p data-characters=211 data-current-count=211 data-injectable=false>It’s interesting to think how things might have ended up for <strong>Predator</strong> and Van Damme’s career in general had the production stuck to its guns, but it worked out pretty well for all parties in the end.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoqZqqlWK9qbvTqGSsoJ%2BswG62xJqlnKSRqrGmedWapWackaK6pnnOq6CgoZ6WuW680Z6bmqyfp3w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
