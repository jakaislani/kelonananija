The reality star’s massive net worth stems partly from her stint on the VH1 program. While she has yet to emerge as a prominent cast member of the program, her time there has been noteworthy, keeping fans interested.</p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Lucia-Pena-1.jpg alt="Lucía Peña" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>She founded the Belle Sky Spa in Atlanta in 2016.

The reality personality is well-known for her feuds, both online and offline.</p><h2>Alexis Skyy’s Love & Hip Hop journey</h2><p>In season five, the Family Reunion: Love & Hip Hop Edition star debuted in the Atlanta part of the show while posing for Tammy Rivera’s swimwear line. She then featured as Jessica Dime’s date in season 6.&nbsp;Her participation in the Hollywood series brought her a lot of recognition, as her conflict with Masika Kalysha became the show’s major emphasis. Skyy is now past the conflict, but when it occurred, all hell broke loose.</p><p>Masika, Moniece, and Misster Ray were on one side of the conflict, while Skyy, Hazel, Nikki, Zell, and Lyrica were on the other. The two had had a quarrel for years, but it all started on Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood when Alexis claimed that Masika became pregnant with Fetty Wap while the two were still in a relationship.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Lucia-Pena-2.jpg alt="Lucía Peña" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The season also included her romance with Solo Lucci, although Alexis had a falling out with Sara Scott, his child’s mother.
