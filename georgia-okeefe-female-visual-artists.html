But that all changed when in 1925 she was involved in a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/artists/frida-kahlo-bus-accident data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="catastrophic bus accident" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">catastrophic bus accident</a>, which left her maimed and in debilitating pain for the rest of her life.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While convalescing in the hospital from her accident, Kahlo began to paint and thus, her new life's purpose was born. Most famous for her surrealist self-portraits, which often depicted symbolic physical and psychological scars — like that of The Two Fridas (1939) — Kahlo emerged as one of the greatest modern painters of all time.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Tazuko Sakane, Japanese Filmmaker</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Born into a wealthy family, Tazuko Sakane cultivated her love of film, thanks to her father, who often took her to the cinema. With his help, she met famed director Kenji Mizoguchi, who offered her a job as a script reviewer. Seeing her potential, Mizoguchi promoted her to editor and then assistant director.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Despite these promotions, Sakane still had to deal with severe sexual discrimination and ended up cutting her hair and dressing like her male colleagues to stave off harassment. She became Japan's first female director in 1936 with Hatsu Sugata, her first and only full-length feature. She also became a pioneering documentarian, traveling to the Chinese region of Manchuria to film the consequences of its war with Japan. Once the war ended, her country enforced a new policy that directors had to possess a university degree, which gave her no choice but to be demoted as a scriptwriter and/or editor. She continued working in these roles until she retired at the age of 46.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Luisa Roldán, Spanish Sculptor</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Known as "La Roldana," Luisa Roldán is the first documented female sculptor in Spain. Taught by her father, who was a celebrated Baroque sculptor himself, Roldán also married a sculptor, but her work was considered superior to theirs.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Famous for her religious-themed colorful wooden statues, which were described as having "clearly delineated profiles, thick locks of hair, billowing draperies, and mystical faces with delicate eyes, knitting brows, rosy cheeks, and slightly parted lips," Roldán produced celebrated sculptures such as Virgen de la Soledad, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/religious-figures/mary-magdalene data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mary Magdalen" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Mary Magdalen</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/religious-figures/jesus-christ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Jesus class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jesus</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/religious-figures/saint-john-the-baptist data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Saint John the Baptist" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Saint John the Baptist</a>. She served on the royal courts of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/royalty/charles-ii-of-england data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Charles II" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Charles II</a>, Philip V and the Duke of Infantado.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Despite her high connections, however, Roldán died in poverty, which was quite common for artists of her era.</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Virginia Oldoini, Italian Photographic Artist</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Although she didn't take the photos herself, Italian aristocrat Virginia Oldoini (aka La Castiglione) had an important role in photography's origins. Besides being known as <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/napoleon-iii data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Napoleon III's" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Napoleon III's</a> mistress, Oldoini was also famous for being one of the first pioneers of the "selfie."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Directing photographer Pierre-Louis Pierson, who ended up capturing 700 images of her, Oldoini documented her most dramatic moments — from dressing in fanciful costumes (like her "Queen of Hearts" gown) to exposing her bare limbs, which was a risqué gesture at the time.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">It's important to note Oldoini was not a passive subject. She was ever-meticulous and specific in her direction to Pierson, choosing the content, angle and scale of each portrait. What resulted are some of the most fascinating and strange portraits ever documented in the genre's history.</p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Jessie Willcox Smith, American Illustrator</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Although she could capture the mood and expressions of children in extraordinary fashion, illustrator Jessie Willcox Smith was never a wife or mother herself. Smith rose to fame during the Golden Age of American illustration and famously became part of the Red Rose Girls, a small group of distinguished female illustrators in Philadelphia.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Smith went on to work for premiere magazines like McClure's, Harper's Bazaar and Scribners and illustrated over 60 books in her career, including <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/louisa-may-alcott data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Louisa May Alcott's" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Louisa May Alcott's</a> Little Women, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/robert-louis-stevenson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Robert Louis Stevenson's" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Robert Louis Stevenson's</a> A Child's Garden of Verses and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/charles-dickens data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Charles Dickens'" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Charles Dickens'</a> David Copperfield.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Between 1918 and 1932, she drew exclusively for Good Housekeeping, which included the celebrated Mother Goose series, and also worked on an advertising project for Ivory soap. Like her colleagues <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/artists/norman-rockwell data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Norman Rockwell" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Norman Rockwell</a> and J. C. Leyendecker, Smith became a media celebrity and was one of the highest-earning illustrators of her day.</p><h5 class="css-1l2lp8z e5xkl6w6"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>PHOTOS: Frida Kahlo & Diego Rivera's Colorful Relationship<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h5><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/1_during-a-pause-in-the-fake-trial-of-leon-trotsky-diego-rivera-a-mural-painter-and-militant-in-the-mexican-revolutionary-communist-patry-had-let-trotsky-stay-at-his-home-during-his-exile-photo-by-key.jpg alt="While taking a break during the “fake trial” of Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky, Kahlo and Rivera share a lighthearted pause." title="While taking a break during the “fake trial” of Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky, Kahlo and Rivera share a lighthearted pause." width=3508 height=2645 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h6 class="css-1wy1tq4 e5xkl6w1">1_during a pause in the 'fake trial' of Leon TROTSKY.
