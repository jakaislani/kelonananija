Nonetheless, the Israeli actress proved her staying power with further appearances in the likes of Shazam! Fury of the Gods and The Flash. So why isn’t a Wonder Woman 3 with Gadot happening? Was she fired?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-wonder-woman-3-isn-t-happening-but-why-was-gal-gadot-let-go data-injectable=false>Wonder Woman 3 isn’t happening, but why was Gal Gadot let go?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/gal-gadot-wonder-woman-1984.jpg><p data-characters=466 data-current-count=766 data-injectable=true>First of all, let’s remember that DC is currently in a time of transition. Former Marvel filmmaker James Gunn officially took over as the new co-chief of DC Studios, alongside producer Peter Safran, in November 2022, with the first slate of movies and TV shows to come from the rebooted DCU announced in January 2023. This confirmed that new incarnations of Superman and Batman would be introduced in such films as Superman: Legacy and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Brave and the Bold</a>.</p><p data-characters=406 data-current-count=406 data-injectable=true>As for the third member of DC’s Trinity, Wonder Woman lore was promised to be kept alive through Paradise Lost, a Max prequel series focusing on the Amazons of Themyscira, Diana’s island home. This came after it was confirmed director <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Patty Jenkins had parted ways with DC</a>, due to creative differences with the new head honchos, and would not be helming the previously announced Wonder Woman 3.</p><p data-characters=515 data-current-count=515 data-injectable=true>We kind of assumed that was that, then, until Gadot claimed that actually she was still attached to WW3 in August 2023, after having a very encouraging meeting with Gunn and Safran. This was swiftly followed by Variety reporting that, despite the actress’ comments, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DC was not moving forward with a third movie for the heroine</a> and was simply focusing on Paradise Lost at this time. Since then, Gadot has not repeated her claims so we’ve been left to assume WW3 is dead and her time in the role is over.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/wonder-woman-shazam-fury-of-the-gods.jpg><p data-characters=288 data-current-count=588 data-injectable=true>So, was Gal Gadot fired? It’s difficult to say. Certainly, it sounds like her interactions with Gunn and Safran were not as final as Henry Cavill’s, who was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">firmly and clearly told his services would no longer be required</a>, with David Corenswet later hired as his replacement.</p><p data-characters=352 data-current-count=352 data-injectable=false>“I was invited to a meeting with James Gunn and Peter Safran,” Gadot revealed to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Flaunt&nbsp;magazine</a>, “and what they told me, and I’m quoting: ‘You’re in the best hands. We’re going to develop&nbsp;Wonder Woman 3&nbsp;with you. [We] love you as Wonder Woman— you’ve got nothing to worry about.’&nbsp;So we’ll see.”</p><p data-characters=549 data-current-count=901 data-injectable=false>Variety‘s insider source made clear that “nothing was ever promised” to the actress regarding WW3, but it sure sounds like Gunn and Safran are big fans of her performance as Diana and so aren’t in a hurry to replace her. That is if they’ve even officially let her go as Wonder Woman. All in all, then, it probably wouldn’t be accurate to say Gadot has been fired and it’s feasible, if a bit of a stretch, that she could still return. Maybe if DC fans grab hold of the Dreamstone and wish really hard…</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorpqrXZyurXnGmpuorF2btrOxw2adq6edYsSwusOeqWavn6Kur3mSZquhnV2ZsG6w0ZqkmmWVrb2trcinnJ1n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
