Ash By Elegance made headlines over the weekend when she popped up at ringside at TNA Hard To Kill. It marked her first appearance following her WWE release in September after a decade with the company.
During a recent appearance on Busted Open Radio, Ash opened up about feeling that WWE officials didn’t have confidence in her, while some producers like TJ Wilson advocated for her."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

(H/t Andrew Thompson of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">POST Wrestling</a> for the transcription.)</p><p>“I honestly think they (WWE) didn’t believe in me. You know, producers, TJ (Wilson) was a very big advocate for me and he would always be like, ‘Dana can do it, Dana can do it, Dana can do it’ and it just — it wasn’t happening and I wasn’t that girl. I wasn’t the girl that they were trying to push to that next level. (I) was the one that I was always given to take the pin fall and I was okay with it, thinking in my mind, there’s gonna be a shot. There’s gonna be that next time and there just never was that next time.”</p><h2 id=h-money-in-the-bank>Money In The Bank</h2><p>“I fought so hard. I’ll never forget this and I think it was 2018 or ‘19 in the Money in the Bank match where I wanted to hang from the briefcase and swing from it and fall and a pile of girls catch me and they’re like, ‘No, no, no. That’s a little too dangerous.’ I’m like, ‘Do you not know I was in gymnastics for 18 years? And the bar was this high. I would do double backflips and layoffs out from underneath the bars. I promise you, I’m okay. Just let me do it’ and it would be a wow factor and I just don’t think that they had the confidence in me.”</p><p>Brooke was in the 2019 women’s Money in the Bank ladder match that was won by Bayley. She was a 15-time WWE 24/7 Champion and was last seen on NXT at the time of her release.</p><p><a href=#>Ash By Elegance (Dana Brooke): You’re Going To See A New Side Of Me In TNA</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNsbmpwZmKutLSMm7BmnZyatKK6wp5knZmelnqjvs6oop5llKSytLrTZpmepJmaw6Z51rCcZqCRmXqku82foJ2dnpiybrXNZp%2Beql2ouKq4y6w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
