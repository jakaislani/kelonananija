Inside a facility, children are being raised by robots, while the outside world is occupied by powerful supernatural creatures.

Perhaps thanks to that, its manga has gathered the attention of many around the world since its debut in January 2018, and it’s about to get some more. In October, Production I.G, a popular Japanese animation studio, announced that an anime adaptation of Heavenly Delusion was in the making, written by Makoto Fukami, best known for his work in Psycho-Pass and the Berserk remake.</p><p data-characters=473 data-current-count=473 data-injectable=true>The first season of Heavenly Delusion is scheduled to premiere on April 1 in Japan on the following networks: Tokyo MX, TV Aichi, Hokkaido TV, MBS, RKB Mainichi Broadcasting, and BS11. Naturally, as the day approaches, international fans of the series are getting antsy, looking for ways to stream the season as soon it is made available. Typically, Crunchyroll is the go-to anime streaming platform for all anime fans, but the case is very different for Heavenly Delusion.</p><h2 id=h-how-to-watch-heavenly-delusion data-injectable=false>How to watch Heavenly Delusion</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=418 data-current-count=718 data-injectable=true>Those looking forward to watching Heavenly Delusion can rest assured, they’ll be able to set sights on it very soon. Disney Platform Distribution has acquired the licensing rights to the anime’s first season, and Disney Plus will be simulcasting it globally. This means that fans will be able to stream the episodes with subtitles only a few hours after they premiere in Japan, exclusively on the platform.</p><p data-characters=363 data-current-count=363 data-injectable=false>Unfortunately for those who prefer their anime dubbed, at the time of writing, there is no word on when the first season will be made available with English dub, so subtitles will have to do the job for the time being. The dub will arrive at some point in the future, though, as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed via Twitter</a> by Disney’s English dubbing senior manager, Reuben Lack.</p><p data-characters=200 data-current-count=563 data-injectable=false>If the anime stays faithful to its source material — and it likely will, as most anime adaptations tend to do — viewers are in for a treat they will not want to miss out on with Heavenly Delusion.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6wn56mXZa7pXnWoZyrnV2pvG7DwK2aoWWYmq63sc2lsGaclaHCtLXOp2Y%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
