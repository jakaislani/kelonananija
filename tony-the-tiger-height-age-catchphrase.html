The longtime mascot for Kellogg’s Frosted Flakes has graced some of the most eye-catching boxes in the cereal aisle, and today we’ll learn a little bit more about what makes this guy tick (NOT snap, crackle or pop, though…those are other guys entirely). Join us today as we tell you everything we know about Tony the Tiger!&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-old-is-tony-the-tiger><strong>How old is Tony the Tiger?</strong></h2><p>Tony the Tiger was created by Eugene Kolkey and Leo Burnett. He made his debut in 1952.&nbsp; Speaking literally, this would make ol’ Tony 70 years old. The average tiger typically only lives about 10-15 years, so Tony must be part cheetah, as it seems he’s been outrunning the Grim Reaper for decades now! But if you want an honest guess regarding the age he is meant to portray…we’d say 34 years old.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-voiced-tony-the-tiger><strong>Who voiced Tony the Tiger?</strong></h2><p>Tony the Tiger has been voiced by a number of voice actors over the years (around 10, if we’re including the actors in different languages). But the most iconic of all of them was Thurl Ravenscroft, who you’d recognize instantly as the singer of “You’re a Mean One Mr. Grinch.” He replaced the original actor, Dallas McKennon, after his short stint in 1952, and remained the voice of Tony until 2005 when he passed away.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-tall-is-tony-the-tiger><strong>How tall is Tony the Tiger?</strong></h2><p>Tony towers over most other cereal mascots at a mighty 6’3’’! We gotta get that Trix Rabbit some protein so he can give this guy a run for his money someday!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-does-tony-the-tiger-say><strong>What does Tony the Tiger say?</strong></h2><p>Tony’s two word catchphrase, in case you’ve somehow never seen a commercial in your lifetime (in which case, I envy you to the ends of the Earth), is, “They’re grrreat!”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-was-tony-the-tiger-created-for><strong>What was Tony the Tiger created for?</strong></h2><p>Funnily enough, Tony wasn’t the hard-and-fast choice for the Kellogg’s Frosted Flakes mascot. When the product was launched, Tony and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">three other characters</a> (Katy the Kangaroo, Elmo the Elephant, and Newt the Gnu) were created as part of a contest. When Tony ran circles around the other contenders, they were dropped from the packaging of “Kellogg’s Sugar Frosted Flakes of Corn” (as it was first known) altogether. Our sympathies to Newt the Gnu…better luck gnext time.&nbsp;</p><p>Tony the Tiger may be a beast of few words, but he’s always welcome at our breakfast table…just as long as he brings the OJ. We only eat complete breakfasts in this house.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaKyfo8ZuwMeeZK2hl5q%2FbrTEop6hrF2WtKZ5wpqrnKCgnb%2Biv8Ro</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
