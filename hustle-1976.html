It's a movie about characters, primarily. It cares more about getting inside these people than it does about solving its crime. And the two leading characters, a Los Angeles police lieutenant and a French prostitute, become unexpectedly interesting because they're made into such individuals by <a href=#>Burt Reynolds</a> and <a href=#>Catherine Deneuve</a>. Sure, the characters sound like clichés -- the cop and the hooker -- and on the basis of their track records, we wouldn't necessarily expect Reynolds or Deneuve to transform them. They've played their share of fairly routine cops and whores before; it's a house specialty. But this time they create an involved, absorbing relationship that works.</p><p>We meet them in bed. We see a lot of them in bed, in fact, and it would be less than honest not to admit that Reynolds and Deneuve -- despite all the old jokes about his Cosmopolitan centerfold and her Chanel ads -- are uncommonly attractive people. But Aldrich doesn't just photograph them, he uses them: Deneuve for the tantalizing aura of icy kinkiness that came through in "<a href=#>Belle de Jour</a>" and "<a href=#>Tristana</a>," and Reynolds for the humor and vulnerability he mixes in with his virility.</p><p>She'd get out of the business in a moment if he'd marry her, she says, although there's a certain fascinating detachment about the way she takes $100 dirty phone calls and spends afternoons on the yachts of rich lawyers. He'd marry her, except he's on the rebound from a bad marriage, and, besides, she's a hooker.</p><p>They almost get this difficulty worked out, but some problems intervene. A girl is found dead beside a swimming pool and the rich lawyer (played by <a href=#>Eddie Albert</a> with that Middle American savagery he has perfected recently) is implicated. The girl's father (<a href=#>Ben Johnson</a>) is convinced that murder is involved. He accuses the cops of being on the take.</p><p>What they know and he doesn't is that the girl had been involved for three years as a prostitute, porno movie star and Sunset Strip stripper and that she almost certainly committed suicide. Reynolds and his partner (<a href=#>Paul Winfield</a>, who played the father in "<a href=#>Sounder</a>") circle around this case while handling whatever else comes up, like a homicidal killer holding hostages. They also drink a lot of Bushmill's Irish Whiskey, which is referred to by name so often it's like <a href=#>Paul Newman</a> ordering a Coors.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46hrKysnJp6coWWbw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
