Painful flashbacks show them fighting over their house and dog; Brandon brought most of the money to the relationship, and so it was Nick who moved out, to a little frame house where the final party will be held. Telling his closest friends (including Charlene, played by <a href=#>Margaret Cho</a>) that it is “Time for Plan B” and he wants to die “while I am still me,” he goes through his Rolodex, making an invitation list: “Dead... dead... dull... dead...” The centerpiece of the movie is Roberts' performance as the dying man. This is a quieter, gentler Eric Roberts than I've seen before. As the friends and family start to gather, he tries to comfort them, bringing to each one what he senses they need. There is some laughter and a few macabre jokes, but basically the party (which stretches to two days because of some latecomers) consists of Nick at the epicenter, brave and sweet, surrounded in the corners of the rooms by many worried and sad conversations.</p><p>“Gay people get to choose their own families,” one of Nick's friends says, “and he chose us.” His biological family is also there: <a href=#>Lee Grant</a>, as his Greek mother, <a href=#>George Segal</a>, as his Jewish father, and <a href=#>Marlee Matlin</a> as his sister. It is clear, in a conversation they have, that his father never accepted Nick’s homosexuality, and buried that and other issues in lifelong alcoholism.</p><p>The father tries to apologize, awkwardly.</p><p>The key event of the party is the arrival of Brandon, the former lover.</p><p>Nick's friends are hostile to him: They think he has his nerve. But Charlene invited him because she senses that Nick will be happy to see him, and although there is still anger and resentment, she is right. “When he got sick, I guess I got scared,” Brandon confesses.</p><p>The idea of voluntary suicide, much in the news because of Dr.</p><p>Kevorkian, is treated here not as an issue but as an accepted choice. In another flashback, we see how Nick and others helped a friend of theirs who chose to kill himself. They leave him to die, and the next day they go to deal with the body, only to discover that he is not yet quite dead. So they follow through.</p><p>This scene will cause the most discussion after the film, and indeed within the film <a href=#>Roddy McDowall</a> plays a Catholic who argues that only God should decide when we die.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46iq6xlna56sa3RrbBmaWlugw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
