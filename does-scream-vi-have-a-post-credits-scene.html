Recommended Videos The latest installment of the Scream franchise has finally arrived with the release of Scream VI. Directed by Tyler Gillett and Matt Bettinelli-Olpin, the film follows the events of Scream (2022) after Sam (Melissa Barrera) and Tara (Jenna Ortega) were attacked in Woodsboro by Richie Kirsch (Jack Quaid) and Amber Freeman (Mikey Madison). But it’s not over for them yet, as Ghostface reappears in the lives of Sam and Tara while Tara is in New York attending college."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But it’s not over for them yet, as Ghostface reappears in the lives of Sam and Tara while Tara is in New York attending college.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=412 data-current-count=412 data-injectable=true>Like the other films in the franchise, Scream VI pokes fun at the horror genre, with this entry making self-reflective jabs at franchise culture more broadly. You would think a slasher series that often comments on the horror genre would have a post-credits scene, but none of the films so far have had one. So, let’s take a look at whether Scream VI is an outlier and if it has any stingers after the credits.</p><h2 id=h-does-scream-vi-have-an-end-credits-scene data-injectable=false>Does Scream VI have an end-credits scene?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Mindy-in-Scream-VI.jpg><p data-characters=348 data-current-count=648 data-injectable=true>In a first for the franchise, Scream VI does actually have an end-credits scene. Of course, there is the usual stinger with Ghostface popping up right after the first credits go by, as they have done in the previous films. But, that isn’t the only thing that is after the credits, with Scream VI having a short scene at the end of the film.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Scream-2022-Ghostface-Bloody-Disgusting-hidden-watermark-scaled-1.jpg><p data-characters=432 data-current-count=432 data-injectable=true>In true Scream fashion, the post-credits scene features Mindy (Jasmin Savoy Brown) poking fun at franchises and post-credits scenes saying, “Not every movie needs a post-credits scene.” The line seems to be directly cut from an earlier scene from the movie where she breaks down the rules of the movie now that they are officially in a franchise. After that fun line, the film fades to black and you can walk out of the theater.</p><p data-characters=422 data-current-count=422 data-injectable=true>So, you will probably want to wait until the end of the film. Even if you don’t want to watch the scene at the end of the credits, it’s a good idea to see the names of all the people who worked on the movie. It is not as if it’s a bad movie, either, reaching some franchise highs, and making some great connections to the previous movies while paving some new ground.
